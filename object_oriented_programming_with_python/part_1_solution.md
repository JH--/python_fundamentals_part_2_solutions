### 1. What is a class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects, or instances of the class. Classes contain information on how to instantiate objects, and define methods that instances (or the class itself) have access to.

### 2. What is an instance?

An instance is an object created from a class.

### 3. What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the idea that data and processes on that data are owned by a class. Other functions or classes outside of that class should not be able to directly change the data.

### 4. What is abstraction?

Abstraction is the process of exposing only relevant, higher level functionality in your class, and hiding unnecessary implementation details from the user. For example, you can sort a list using `list.sort` without having to know what specific sorting algorithm is being used.

### 5. What is inheritance?

Inheritance is when one class inherits properties and methods from another (called a parent or base) class.

### 6. What is multiple inheritance?

Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from many other classes, not just one.

### 7. What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism is what allows us to use the same interace (or method) for instances of different classes. 

### 8. What is method resolution order or MRO?

The method resolution order specifies the order in which Python searches classes when looking for a particular method.
